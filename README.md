# Water Quality Analysis Repository

## Repository Description
This repository contains Python scripts and analytical tools designed for comprehensive assessment and statistical analysis of water quality, specifically focusing on heavy metal contamination and general pollution indicators. It includes robust methodologies such as correlation analysis, cluster analysis (K-means clustering), the Elbow method, silhouette score analysis, Water Quality Index (WQI), and Water Pollution Index (WPI) calculations, making it ideal for researchers and environmental scientists working on water quality monitoring projects.

## üìë Data Requirements

Your input Excel file (`water_quality_data.xlsx`) must contain the following sheets:

- **Data Sheet:** Named `"Data"`, includes raw data of measured concentrations.
- **Standards Sheet:** Named `"Standards"`, defines permissible limits for each parameter.

### Example (`Data` sheet):

| Sample ID | Fe  | Zn  | Cu  | Mn  | Ni   | Cr   | Co  | pH  | EC  | TDS |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| GW1       | 0.3 | 1.2 | 0.2 | 0.1 | 0.05 | 0.02 | 0.1 | 6.8 | 250 | 450 |

### Example (`Standards` sheet):

| Parameter | Permissible Limit (Si) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Fe        | 0.3                    |
| Zn        | 3                      |
| pH_low    | 6.5                    |
| pH_high   | 8.5                    |
| ...       | ...                    |
